        "\n",
        "ans- In Python, both functions and methods are blocks of reusable code designed to perform specific tasks, but their key distinction lies in their association with classes and objects.\n",
        "Function:\n",
        "A function is a standalone block of code that is defined independently and can be called by its name.\n",
        "Functions are not inherently tied to any specific object or class.\n",
        "They operate on data passed to them as arguments and typically return a result.\n",
        "Functions are used for general-purpose tasks or reusable logic that does not depend on the internal state of an object.Method:\n",
        "A method is a function that belongs to a class and is associated with an object (an instance of that class).\n",
        "Methods are defined within a class and are called on an object using dot notation (e.g., object.method()).\n",
        "The first argument of a method is conventionally self, which refers to the instance of the class on which the method is called, allowing it to access and manipulate the object's attributes and other methods.\n",
        "Methods are used to encapsulate behaviors and operations that are specific to the data and state of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "q.2 Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "ans-In Python, the terms \"parameters\" and \"arguments\" are distinct concepts related to functions:\n",
        "Parameters: These are the variables defined within the parentheses in a function's definition. They act as placeholders or names for the values that the function expects to receive when it is called. Parameters define the signature of the function, indicating what inputs it can accept.\n",

        "q. 3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans-Defining a Function in Python\n",
        "Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses () which may contain parameters, and a colon :. The code block that constitutes the function's body must be indented. An optional return statement can be used to send a value back to the caller.\n",
        "Calling a Function in Python\n",
        "To execute a defined function, it must be called. This is done by writing the function's name followed by parentheses (), which enclose any necessary arguments that correspond to the function's parameters.\n",
        "q.4-What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans- The return statement in a Python function serves two primary purposes:\n",
        "Exiting the Function:\n",
        "When a return statement is encountered during the execution of a function, it immediately terminates the function's execution. Control is then passed back to the point in the code where the function was called. Any code within the function after the return statement will not be executed.\n",
        "Returning a Value:\n",
        "The return statement can be used to send a value (or multiple values, or even a complex data structure) back to the caller of the function. This returned value can then be used in the calling code, for example, by assigning it to a variable, using it in an expression, or passing it as an argument to another function. If no value is specified with the return statement, or if the return statement is omitted entirely, the function implicitly returns None.\n",
        "\n",
        "q.5-What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",

        "\n",
        "ans-In Python, a generator is a special type of iterator that allows you to create sequences of values on demand, rather than storing the entire sequence in memory at once. This is achieved using the yield keyword within a function, which suspends the function's execution and returns a value, allowing it to be resumed later from where it left off.\n",
        "How Generators are Defined:\n",
        "A generator function in Python is defined like a regular function, but instead of using return to send back a value, it uses yield. When a generator function is called, it doesn't execute the code immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator.\n",
        "Key Differences from Regular Functions:\n",
        "yield vs. return:\n",
        "Regular functions use return to send back a single value and exit. Generator functions use yield to return a value and pause execution, maintaining their state.\n",
        "Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "Generators are memory-efficient because they produce values one at a time, only when requested, rather than storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation:\n",
        "Generators use lazy evaluation, meaning they only compute the next value when it's needed, making them ideal for working with large or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "q.7- What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans-Unlike a regular function, a generator does not return its results all at once. Instead, it yields its values one by one, each time it is called. This makes it possible to generate an infinite sequence of values, as long as there is sufficient memory to store them\n",
        "\n",
        "q.8 What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans-A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It can have any number of arguments, but only one expression. Lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations, especially when you need to pass a function as an argument to another function (like map, filter, or sorted).\n",

        "q.9 Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "ans-The map() function in Python is a built-in higher-order function that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, or set) and returns a map object, which is an iterator containing the results.\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "The primary purpose of map() is to perform transformations on iterables efficiently and concisely, without the need for explicit loops. It facilitates a functional programming style by applying a function across a collection of data.\n",
        "Usage:\n",

        "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",

        "iterable:\n",
        "This is the sequence or collection whose elements will be processed by the function. You can provide multiple iterables if the function is designed to accept multiple arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "q.10-. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "ans- The map(), filter(), and reduce() functions in Python are higher-order functions used for processing iterables in a functional programming style. They differ in their purpose and the type of output they produce.\n",
        "map():\n",
        "Purpose: Applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator yielding the results. It transforms each element individually.\n",
